Civil Registry System is the online system which helps citizens to apply passport, licence, PAN-card etc. and register birth and death certificates.
Our goal is to provide a website which helps citizens to register and apply Government related Documents easily.
The main purpose of the web site is to reduce the effort by the candidate and save his time and avoid unwanted rushes at the government offices.
